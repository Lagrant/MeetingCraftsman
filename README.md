### Updated

Current source code contains UI elements from [Design Support Library](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2015/05/android-design-support-library.html). If you still want to see how custom implementations of e.g. Floating Action Button or Navigation drawer work, just checkout this source code on tag [Post 8](https://github.com/Lagrant/MeetingCraftsman).
